# Simple Quiz

## Objective

The project aimed to develop a simple quiz application using Python that asks users three questions, evaluates their answers, and provides a score at the end. The goal was to practice Python programming skills, particularly in user input handling, conditional statements, and basic program flow.

### Skills Learned

- Python Programming: Writing and executing Python scripts.
- Conditionals: Implementing if-else logic to check user answers and provide feedback.
- User Input Handling: Reading and processing user inputs to determine quiz responses.
- Basic Program Flow: Structuring a program to sequentially ask questions and tally the score.

### Tools Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the quiz.
- PyCharm: An integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing, running, and debugging the quiz script.

### Outcome
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to create a basic quiz application using Python. The quiz could ask users three questions, evaluate their answers, and provide a final score, showcasing fundamental skills in Python programming and user interaction handling.
